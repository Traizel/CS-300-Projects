## DriverPass System Design Reflection

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was **DriverPass**, a company that wanted to help students better prepare for their driving exams. Their research showed that many students failed because they only studied written tests rather than practicing driving skills. DriverPass requested a **web based system** that would allow students to access online practice exams, schedule driving lessons with instructors, and purchase training packages. The system needed to handle account management, scheduling, payments, and communication between students, instructors, and administrators.

### What did you do particularly well?

I did a great job **analyzing the client’s requirements** and translating them into clear business and functional needs. My **use case and activity diagrams** were well organized and accurately represented how users would interact with the system. I also focused on creating documentation that was clear, professional, and easy for nontechnical stakeholders to understand, which made the system’s functionality and flow easy to follow.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part, I would enhance the **system design document** by adding more technical detail about the backend architecture such as database structure and data flow between system components. Including a high level ER diagram or sequence diagram for user authentication and scheduling would make the design more complete and implementation ready.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the client interview and identifying key goals like convenience, accessibility, and reliability. These needs shaped my design decisions, for example, implementing a cloud based solution accessible from anywhere, supporting secure online payments, and allowing flexible scheduling. Considering user needs is critical because a system is only successful if it solves real problems and provides a positive experience for the people who use it.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I start by **gathering and clarifying requirements**, then move into **creating models and diagrams** to visualize processes and interactions. I focus on understanding user workflows before deciding on technical solutions. In the future, I plan to use **Agile and iterative design techniques**, incorporating user feedback early and often. I would also use **UML modeling and prototyping tools** to validate designs before full development begins.
